// An algorithm is a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

// George Polya - How To Solve It

// Understand the problem
//  Can I restate the problem in my own words
//  What are the inputs that go into it
//  What outputs should come from the solution
//  Can the ouputs be determined from the inputs
//  How should I label the important pieces of data

// Explore concrete examples
//  Start with simple examples
//  Progress to more complex examples
//  Explore examples with empty inputs
//  Explore examples with invalid inputs

// Break it down
//  Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

// Solve/Simplify
//  Solve the problem if you can, solve a simpler version of the problem if you cant
//  Find the difficulty
//  Temporarily ignore it
//  Write a simplified solution
//  Now incorporate the difficulty

// Look back and refactor
//  Can you check the result
//  Can you derive the result differently
//  Can you understand it at a glance
//  Can you use the result or method for other problems
//  Can you improve the performance
//  Can you think of other ways to refactor
//  How have other people solved this problem
